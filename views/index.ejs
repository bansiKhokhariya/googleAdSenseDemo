    <p>The word Mother is a very pious word and whosoever is called by the name ‘Mother’ is a person who sacrifices and
        prioritizes her children over anything. Her whole Life revolves around the well-being of her child, their
        growth, their development, and their welfare. A Mother not just only gives birth to a child but she takes a
        Lifelong commitment to take care of her child.

        The only unconditional love in the world is the mother's love. My mother is my inspiration, my superhero, my
        best friend, and my guiding light. My life would not have been beautiful without my mother. Through ups and
        downs and in every step of life, she holds my hand and supports and encourages me. No matter what happens, my
        mother is always there beside me- cheering me up and motivating me. All mothers in the world are great and so,
        we should not celebrate their contribution in our life on Mother's Day only, which is 10th May, but every day of
        the year and throughout their life. It is because no gesture of appreciation is ever enough when it comes to
        acknowledging our mother. Her selfless love and sacrifice are the precious of all gifts under the sun.
